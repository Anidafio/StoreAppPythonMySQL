### Project Guidelines

## Project Goal:
Create a Python application that connects to a MySQL server,
and performs CRUD operations on a database. The application should model a store,
where users can create accounts, purchase products, and look at a history of their
orders. There should also be an admin feature where the admin should be able to 
see all orders and users. 

    - The application must be able to create, read, update, and delete.
    - Use at least 3 different tables/collections (also create an ERD)
    - The application must have a login feature, as well as user/admin roles
    - Logging of events should be implemented (connecting to db, interacting with db/files, etc.)

Your "store" can be whatever you want (furniture, appliances, movies, etc.). Some 
admin features that you may want to implement: modifying inventory, removing/editing users,
granting admin access to specific users...
